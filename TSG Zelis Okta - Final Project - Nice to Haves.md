# Zelis Okta TSG Cohort - Final Project - Nice-to-Haves

## 1) Audit Dashboard Filters & Sorting
Add timeframe or user filters (e.g., last 24h/7d/30d) and basic sorting in the dashboard.  

## 2) GraphQL Extras
- Add a `me` query to return the current userâ€™s profile.  
- Allow `securityEvents` to be filterable by timeframe or paginated.  

## 3) Accessibility Detail
Improve the UI with accessibility features like keyboard focus states and proper ARIA attributes.  

## 4) Multi-Factor Authentication Toggle
Add a configuration option to enforce Okta MFA for sign-ins.  

## 5) Provider Badges on Events
Show which provider (Okta, Google, Microsoft) was used for each login in the dashboard, using labels or icons.  

## 6) Role Change History in User Details
On the role assignment screen, display a small audit history of past role changes for the selected user.  

## 7) Have an idea for something else you'd like to work?
Keep it related to the stack. If you are feeling creative and have an idea for a feature you think would be useful, go for it!
